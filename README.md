### Hi there 👋



My name is David. I'm a Front End Web Developer from Gulf Shores, AL.

I am currently attending the March 2021 #VetsWhoCode bootcamp learning to dev.
Fun fact: I didn't start learning to dev until I was in my late 30s. 
Ask me about my military service and law enforcement experience.
Ask me about getting coffee.
